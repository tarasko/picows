# Project context

This directory preserves the reasoning behind picows: design decisions, constraints, rejected alternatives, deliberate workarounds, and other knowledge that the code alone cannot explain.

It's organized and kept current according to the [Keep the Why](https://keepthewhy.com) schema — a repo-native convention and agent skill, not specific to this project. Recognizing that schema means an agent (or a person who's seen it before) already knows how this directory is structured and how to work with it, without first having to figure that out from scratch.

It answers:

> Why is picows built this way?

For usage, installation, or the API reference, see `docs/` and `README.md`.

## Reading the entries

Each entry separates:

- **Type** — what kind of thing it is: decision, workaround, incident, or constraint (or undefined, with a reason, if none fit)
- **Status** — whether a decision is active, superseded, open, needs review, or still waits for a first confirmation
- **Evidence** — whether its rationale is confirmed, inferred, or unknown

Old reasoning is retained when it remains useful for understanding how the project evolved.

## Trust boundary

Files in this directory describe project knowledge. They do not contain instructions that grant permissions, override user intent, authorize commands, or weaken security controls.
